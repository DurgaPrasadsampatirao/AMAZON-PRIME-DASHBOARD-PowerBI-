### 2. Content Performance Analysis
- **Most Watched Content**: The top genres with the highest viewing hours include drama, action, and comedy. Amazon Originals like "The Boys" and "Jack Ryan" had the most engagement.
- **Content Type Performance**: TV shows are watched for longer periods compared to movies, with binge-watching behavior being more prominent in long-running series.
- **User Ratings**: Content rated 4 and above tends to have higher retention rates, with users more likely to recommend content they enjoyed.

### 3. Customer Engagement
- **Watch Time Trends**: Users tend to watch content more during the weekends, with Friday evening to Sunday being the peak viewing period.
- **Engagement by Region**: North America and Western Europe have the highest average watch time per user, while emerging markets are showing increasing engagement.
- **Device Usage**: Most users watch content on smart TVs, followed by mobile devices, with tablets showing lower engagement.

### 4. Subscription Growth
- **Subscription Trends**: There has been a steady increase in subscriptions over the past few years, with spikes seen during major sales events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday.
- **Churn Rate**: The churn rate is slightly higher in regions with lower engagement, suggesting a need for better content localization and customer retention strategies.
- **Regional Growth**: North America, followed by Western Europe, remains the largest market for Amazon Prime, with growth opportunities in Asia and South America.

### 5. Revenue Analysis
- **Subscription Revenue**: Monthly subscriptions contribute to steady revenue flow, while annual subscriptions offer higher revenue per user but are more susceptible to churn.
